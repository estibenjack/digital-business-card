                    I&apos;m a frontend developer with a passion for learning new ways to enhance my coding abilities. 
                    After years of studying Spanish, French and Portuguese, I&apos;ve recently taken the leap and started learning
                     another kind of languages. With HTML, CSS and JavaScript under my belt, I&apos;m excited to be adding
                      React to my skill set.

                    When I&apos;m not learning to code, you&apos;ll most likely find me spending time
                     with my dogs or listening to Spanish and Brazilian bops.
